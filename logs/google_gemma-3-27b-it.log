Generate a valid postgres query that best answers the question `Which students have declared a minor program? List their firstname and lastname. Order the results by the students' last names.`.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I will reflect on the user's request before answering the question.

I was asked to generate a SQL query for this question: `Which students have declared a minor program? List their firstname and lastname. Order the results by the students' last names.`


Additionally, I was asked to follow the instructions below to generate the query:
student.declare_major is null for students who have not declared their major.
student.minor is null for students who have not declared a minor program.


With this in mind, here is the postgres query that best answers the question while only using appropriate tables and columns from the DDL statements:
```sql

GOLDEN_QUERY: SELECT student.firstname, student.lastname FROM student WHERE student.minor IS NOT NULL ORDER BY student.lastname NULLS LAST;

Generate a valid postgres query that best answers the question `Which state code is Orlando International Airport in?`.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I will reflect on the user's request before answering the question.

I was asked to generate a SQL query for this question: `Which state code is Orlando International Airport in?`


Additionally, I was asked to follow the instructions below to generate the query:
Filter airport, city, country names using ILIKE.
Filter state code (eg NY), airport codes (eg JFK) using case-insensitive matches.
If multiple flight days are requested, use ILIKE and wildcards for each of the days separately, since they are not necessarily ordered.


With this in mind, here is the postgres query that best answers the question while only using appropriate tables and columns from the DDL statements:
```sql

I will reflect on the user's request before answering the question.

I was asked to generate a SQL query for this question: `What is the total cost of all round-trip fares from New York (JFK) to Los Angeles?`


Additionally, I was asked to follow the instructions below to generate the query:
Filter airport, city, country names using ILIKE.
Filter state code (eg NY), airport codes (eg JFK) using case-insensitive matches.
fare.round_trip_required is not needed when getting the round trip cost.


With this in mind, here is the postgres query that best answers the question while only using appropriate tables and columns from the DDL statements:
```sql

RESPONSE: 
FILTERED_RESPONSE: ;
GOLDEN_QUERY: SELECT SUM(fare.round_trip_cost) AS total_round_trip_cost FROM fare WHERE fare.from_airport = 'JFK' AND fare.to_airport = 'LAX';
CORRECT: 0
EXACT_MATCH: 0

I was asked to generate a SQL query for this question: `How many months between June 2021 and December 2021 had reviews?`



With this in mind, here is the postgres query that best answers the question while only using appropriate tables and columns from the DDL statements:
```sql

RESPONSE: 
FILTERED_RESPONSE: ;
GOLDEN_QUERY: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT MONTH) AS num_months FROM review WHERE YEAR = 2021 AND CASE MONTH WHEN 'January' THEN 1 WHEN 'February' THEN 2 WHEN 'March' THEN 3 WHEN 'April' THEN 4 WHEN 'May' THEN 5 WHEN 'June' THEN 6 WHEN 'July' THEN 7 WHEN 'August' THEN 8 WHEN 'September' THEN 9 WHEN 'October' THEN 10 WHEN 'November' THEN 11 WHEN 'December' THEN 12 END BETWEEN 6 AND 12;
