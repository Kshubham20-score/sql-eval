Generate a valid postgres query that best answers the question `Which organizations have authors who have written publications in the domain "Machine Learning"?`.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I will reflect on the user's request before answering the question.

I was asked to generate a SQL query for this question: `Which organizations have authors who have written publications in the domain "Machine Learning"?`


Additionally, I was asked to follow the instructions below to generate the query:
Always filter names using an exact match


With this in mind, here is the postgres query that best answers the question while only using appropriate tables and columns from the DDL statements:
```sql

Generate a valid postgres query that best answers the question `How long has it been in days since the last admitted student? Give the answer as an integer.`.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I will reflect on the user's request before answering the question.

I was asked to generate a SQL query for this question: `How long has it been in days since the last admitted student? Give the answer as an integer.`



With this in mind, here is the postgres query that best answers the question while only using appropriate tables and columns from the DDL statements:
```sql

Generate a valid postgres query that best answers the question `Return the course id's that are offered in either semesters 1 or 2 and ends before 1pm and had an instructor on thursday`.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I will reflect on the user's request before answering the question.

I was asked to generate a SQL query for this question: `Return the course id's that are offered in either semesters 1 or 2 and ends before 1pm and had an instructor on thursday`



With this in mind, here is the postgres query that best answers the question while only using appropriate tables and columns from the DDL statements:
```sql

RESPONSE: SELECT course_id
FROM course_offering
WHERE semester IN (1, 2)
AND end_time < '13:00:00'
AND thursday IS NOT NULL
```








































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































FILTERED_RESPONSE: SELECT course_id
FROM course_offering
WHERE semester IN (1, 2)
AND end_time < '13:00:00'
AND thursday IS NOT NULL;
GOLDEN_QUERY: SELECT DISTINCT co.course_id FROM course_offering co JOIN offering_instructor oi ON co.offering_id = oi.offering_id WHERE (co.semester = 1 OR co.semester = 2) AND co.end_time < '13:00:00' AND co.thursday IS NOT NULL;
CORRECT: 1

Generate a valid postgres query that best answers the question `Return the student IDs who have taken an in-person course and have gotten a grade of A or C.`.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I will reflect on the user's request before answering the question.

I was asked to generate a SQL query for this question: `Return the student IDs who have taken an in-person course and have gotten a grade of A or C.`


Additionally, I was asked to follow the instructions below to generate the query:
Always filter strings with an exact match.
When asked for specific students or courses, do not return duplicates.


With this in mind, here is the postgres query that best answers the question while only using appropriate tables and columns from the DDL statements:
```sql

RESPONSE: SELECT student_id
FROM student_record
WHERE course_id IN (
  SELECT course_id
  FROM course_offering
  WHERE how = 'in-person'
)
AND grade IN ('A', 'C')

FILTERED_RESPONSE: SELECT student_id
FROM student_record
WHERE course_id IN (
  SELECT course_id

  WHERE how = 'in-person'
)
AND grade IN ('A', 'C');
GOLDEN_QUERY: SELECT DISTINCT student_id FROM student_record WHERE student_record.how = 'in-person' AND student_record.grade IN ('A', 'C');

Generate a valid postgres query that best answers the question `What's the average duration between departure and arrival times minus 34 minutes? Convert from UNIX to regular datetime, and return the answer in minutes`.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I will reflect on the user's request before answering the question.

I was asked to generate a SQL query for this question: `What's the average duration between departure and arrival times minus 34 minutes? Convert from UNIX to regular datetime, and return the answer in minutes`



With this in mind, here is the postgres query that best answers the question while only using appropriate tables and columns from the DDL statements:
```sql

Generate a valid postgres query that best answers the question `Count the number of flight departures for each month?`.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I will reflect on the user's request before answering the question.

I was asked to generate a SQL query for this question: `Count the number of flight departures for each month?`



With this in mind, here is the postgres query that best answers the question while only using appropriate tables and columns from the DDL statements:
```sql

RESPONSE: SELECT
  month.month_name,
  COUNT(flight.flight_id)
FROM
  month
  LEFT JOIN flight ON month.month_number = EXTRACT(month FROM flight.departure_time)
GROUP BY
  month.month_name
ORDER BY
  month.month_number

I will reflect on the user's request before answering the question.

I was asked to generate a SQL query for this question: `What is the total cost of round-trip fares for each airline code?`



With this in mind, here is the postgres query that best answers the question while only using appropriate tables and columns from the DDL statements:

Generate a valid postgres query that best answers the question `How many flights require a round-trip to purchase the fare?`.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I will reflect on the user's request before answering the question.

I was asked to generate a SQL query for this question: `How many flights require a round-trip to purchase the fare?`


Additionally, I was asked to follow the instructions below to generate the query:
Filter airport, city, country names using ILIKE.
Filter state code (eg NY) and airport codes (eg JFK) using upper-case matches.


With this in mind, here is the postgres query that best answers the question while only using appropriate tables and columns from the DDL statements:
```sql

RESPONSE: SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM flight
WHERE round_trip_required = 'Yes'

I was asked to generate a SQL query for this question: `What are the top 10 ticker symbols by total transaction amount? Return the ticker symbol, number of transactions and total transaction amount.`



With this in mind, here is the postgres query that best answers the question while only using appropriate tables and columns from the DDL statements:
```sql

FROM sbTransaction
INNER JOIN sbTicker
ON sbTxTickerId = sbTickerId

LIMIT 10;
```

Additionally, I was asked to follow the instructions below to generate the query:
To get the success rate of transactions per customer, join customer and transaction tables, group by customer, and calculate the percentage of successful transactions.


With this in mind, here is the postgres query that best answers the question while only using appropriate tables and columns from the DDL statements:
```sql

RESPONSE: SELECT sbCustName, ROUND(100 * COUNT(sbTxStatus)::numeric / COUNT(sbTxId)::numeric, 2) AS success_rate
FROM sbCustomer
JOIN sbTransaction ON sbCustId = sbTxCustId
WHERE COUNT(sbTxId) >= 5
GROUP BY sbCustName
ORDER BY success_rate ASC;
```

Additionally, I was asked to follow the instructions below to generate the query:
To get the total sales amount per salesperson, join the salespersons and sales tables, group by salesperson, and sum the sale_price.
Always order results with NULLS last.


With this in mind, here is the postgres query that best answers the question while only using appropriate tables and columns from the DDL statements:
```sql

RESPONSE: SELECT salespersons.id, salespersons.first_name, salespersons.last_name, SUM(sales.sale_price) AS total_sales
FROM salespersons
JOIN sales ON salespersons.id = sales.salesperson_id
GROUP BY salespersons.id, salespersons.first_name, salespersons.last_name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC NULLS LAST
LIMIT 5;

I will reflect on the user's request before answering the question.

I was asked to generate a SQL query for this question: `What are the PMSPS and PMSR in the last 6 months excluding the current month, for salespersons hired between 2022 and 2023 (both inclusive)? Return all months in your answer, including those where metrics are 0. Order by month ascending.`


Additionally, I was asked to follow the instructions below to generate the query:
PMSPS = per month salesperson sales count.
PMSR = per month sales revenue in dollars.
Truncate date to month for aggregation.

I was asked to generate a SQL query for this question: `What is the ASP for sales made in the first quarter of 2023?`


Additionally, I was asked to follow the instructions below to generate the query:
ASP = Average Sale Price in the first quarter of 2023.


With this in mind, here is the postgres query that best answers the question while only using appropriate tables and columns from the DDL statements:

Generate a valid postgres query that best answers the question `Return each doctor's doc_id, specialty, number of distinct drugs prescribed, and SDR`.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I will reflect on the user's request before answering the question.

I was asked to generate a SQL query for this question: `Return each doctor's doc_id, specialty, number of distinct drugs prescribed, and SDR`


Additionally, I was asked to follow the instructions below to generate the query:
SDR = a doctor's rank within their specialty by number of distinct drugs prescribed.
Doctors prescribing more drugs will have a higher rank

Generate a valid postgres query that best answers the question `What is the total number of wallet transactions sent by each user that is not a merchant? Return the user ID and total transaction count.`.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I will reflect on the user's request before answering the question.

I was asked to generate a SQL query for this question: `What is the total number of wallet transactions sent by each user that is not a merchant? Return the user ID and total transaction count.`


Additionally, I was asked to follow the instructions below to generate the query:
To get the total number of transactions per user, join the users and wallet_transactions_daily tables in a CTE, then aggregate by user_id and count the number of transactions


With this in mind, here is the postgres query that best answers the question while only using appropriate tables and columns from the DDL statements:
```sql

Generate a valid postgres query that best answers the question `Which users from the US have unread promotional notifications? Return the username and the total number of unread promotional notifications.`.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I will reflect on the user's request before answering the question.

I was asked to generate a SQL query for this question: `Which users from the US have unread promotional notifications? Return the username and the total number of unread promotional notifications.`


Additionally, I was asked to follow the instructions below to generate the query:
User country should be matched case-insensitively, e.g., LOWER(users.country) = 'us'.
Notification type and status should be matched exactly.


With this in mind, here is the postgres query that best answers the question while only using appropriate tables and columns from the DDL statements:
```sql

RESPONSE: SELECT
  users.username,
  COUNT(notifications.id) AS unread_promotional_notifications
FROM
  consumer_div.users
  LEFT JOIN consumer_div.user_sessions ON users.uid = user_sessions.user_id
  LEFT JOIN consumer_div.notifications ON user_sessions.user_id = notifications.user_id
WHERE
  LOWER(users.country) = 'us'
  AND notifications.type = 'promotion'
  AND notifications.status = 'unread'
GROUP BY
  users.username
ORDER BY
  unread_promotional_notifications DESC
```

I was asked to generate a SQL query for this question: `Calculate the CPUR for each merchant, considering only successful transactions. Return the merchant name and CPUR.`


Additionally, I was asked to follow the instructions below to generate the query:
CPUR (coupon usage rate) = number of distinct coupons used / number of distinct transactions


With this in mind, here is the postgres query that best answers the question while only using appropriate tables and columns from the DDL statements:
```sql
